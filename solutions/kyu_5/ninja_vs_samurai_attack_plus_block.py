"""Ninja vs Samurai: Attack + Block
https://www.codewars.com/kata/ninja-vs-samurai-attack-plus-block

Something is wrong with our Warrior class. All variable should initialize
properly and the attack method is not working as expected.

If properly set, it should correctly calculate the damage after an attack
(if the attacker position is == to the block position of the defender,
no damage; otherwise, the defender gets either 10 damage if hit "high" or
5 damage if it "low". If no block is set, the defender takes 5 **extra** damage
to his health.

For some reason, the health value is not being properly set. The following
shows an example of this code being used:

```python
ninja = Warrior('Hanzo Hattori')
samurai = Warrior('Ry≈çma Sakamoto')

samurai.block = 'l'
ninja.attack(samurai, 'h')
#samurai.health should be 90 now
```

The warriors must be able to fight to the bitter end, and good luck to the most
skilled!

Notice that health can't be below 0: once hit to 0 health, a warrior attribute
`deceased` becomes true; if hit again, the `zombie` attribute becomes true too!
