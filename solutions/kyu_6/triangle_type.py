"""Triangle type
http://www.codewars.com/kata/53907ac3cd51b69f790006c5

In this kata, you should calculate type of triangle with three given sides
a, b and c (given in any order).

If all angles are less than 90째, this triangle is acute and function should
return 1.

If one angle is strictly 90째, this triangle is right and function should
return 2.

If one angle more than 90째, this triangle is obtuse and function should
return 3.

If three sides cannot form triangle, or one angle is 180째 (which turns
triangle into segment) - function should return 0.

Input parameters are sides of given triangle. All input values are
non-negative floating point or integer numbers (or both).
